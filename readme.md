# Learn git through Problem Based Learning

Git is one of those skills that is easier to learn by doing it rather than trying to memorise the commands. This series of exercises uses the [gitruler](https://github.com/rcraggs/gitruler) tool to allow you to check your skills as you progress.

## Introduction

Before you run these exercises you will need to download `gitruler.jar` from [https://github.com/rcraggs/gitruler/releases/latest](https://github.com/rcraggs/gitruler/releases/latest).

Each of the exercises can be completed as follows:

1. Clone or Fork the exercise. Instructions can be found in the "Cloning an existing repository" section of [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and on the [Github help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
2. Follow the instructions to perform updates on the repository that you have cloned. Use the resources and your own research to work out how to perform the actions - that's the key part of the learning process. 
3. Continually run `java -jar <path-to-gitrule.jar>` to check your progress. Once you are finished push the repository to the remote.
