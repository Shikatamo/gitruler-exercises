# Learn git through Problem Based Learning

Git is one of those skills that is easier to learn by doing it rather than trying to memorise the commands. This series of exercises uses the [gitruler](https://github.com/rcraggs/gitruler) tool to allow you to check your skills as you progress.

1. [Introduction](#introduction) - some background theory that will help sooner or later
1. [Section A](https://github.com/UOL-CS/gitruler-a-1) - configuring git, committing updates to tracked files and pushing changes to origin
2. Section B - Tracking a new file, staging specific files for a commit and checking the repository status

## Introduction

To be able to use these exercises you need to be be able to `clone` a repository. Examples of instructions on how to do this are in the "Cloning an existing repository" section of [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) and on the [Github help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).
